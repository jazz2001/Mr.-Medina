<p>YESS Mentoring is a program that Mr. Medina runs in Abraham lincoln after school on Tuesday's and Thursday's. During that period of time the YESS Mentoring program helps young teens like me to get back on track. There are tutor's that every student has assigned and its a time to catch up on work and do homework. The YESS Mentoring program has influenced me in a very good way by staying on track and having good grades. Mr. Medina has been a great influence in my life , he's a role model I can go to for help and I know he's always there to help me. Mr. Medina grew up in the streets and did what every young teen likes to do. Such as ditching , not doing work but that's why he dedicates himself to helping teens like us to succeed. The YESS Mentoring program has helped me to be successful as well as other student's and I thank Mr. Medina
